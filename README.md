# SoftConst

Elements of Software Construction Project

Deployed on https://sutd-chat.herokuapp.com.

Note: The system is tested fully only on Google Chrome. Other browsers may experience more minor bugs that are unknown to us. For example, Firefox does not use webkit scrollbars, so the scrollbar background is not overwritten by this webapp.

# Instructions for local deployment and testing

1.  Clone the project

2.  Open terminal and "cd" into the project

3.  Run "meteor npm install" to get the depencies

4.  Run "meteor" for the production app
